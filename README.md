# ML-ETo-Estimator
ETo model analysis for outdoor irrigation to support water and vegetation management in semi-arid urban households.
Includes the evaluation of the following data driven algorithms: Linear Regression, XGBRegressor, MLP, GRU, LSTM, Conv-LSTM to estimate reference evapotranspiration (ETo) from weather station data. 

# Data Sources
Chihuahua Central Board of Water and Sanitation (JCAS)    
Data derived from 33 Davis Vantage Pro II model ground weather stations publicly available online.
